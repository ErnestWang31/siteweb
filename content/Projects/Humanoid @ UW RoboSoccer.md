Tracking the progress of UW RoboSoccer

We are competing in the 2026 RoboCup in South Korea.
- Building 4 ~50cm tall humanoid robots to play soccer
- Example of robots playing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vxxrlv6Ohew
- We are trying to revolutionize the competition by introducing full Reinforcement Learning control, from bipedal movements to game theory
- We are also looking for funding! Please reach out!
