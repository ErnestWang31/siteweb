#### Studying Mechatronics @ [UWaterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/)
- Currently working on reverse-engineering EV hardware and software, and telematics firmware and mechanical at [Geotab](https://www.geotab.com/)
#### Outside of studying and making things, I:
- play soccer,

#### My Projects:
Making projects is 
- my way of learning and applying my knowledge,
- discovering new ways of robot-making,
- and connecting with people during the process.
