- [[Batteries @ Midnight Sun]] - *make sure that thing stays moving*
- [[Mechatronics Intern @ Paragon Systems]] - *developed end-of-line testers for Ford* 
##### Projects: *making stuff that i like*
- [[arm]] - *an ongoing project i hope to encapsulate all my engineering knowledge - multiple small projects together and referencing various open-sourced projects* - [Github](https://github.com/ErnestWang31/arm)
	- Currently consists of:
		1. [[Arm Mechanical|Mechanical Models]]
		2. [[Robot Development Board]] - *STM32F4-based robotics/embedded projects development board, brain of projects*
		3. [[Stepper Motor Driver]]
		4. [[Robotic Arm Theories]] - *learning about controls, kinematics and kinetics of a robot arm*
- [[Autonomous RC-Car]] - *researching ways to make a RC-Car move fast and by itself*
- [[Closed Loop Stepper Motor Driver]] - *i wanted to design a closed loop driver for all my future projects*
- [[Portfolio Management with Deep Learning]] - *part of [[WatAI]]
- [[Floor Cleaner Bot]] - *first year design project*
##### Interests:
- I play [[Soccer]] - *team Ontario once apon a time*
- I [[Running|run]] - *first half-marathon in May - goal is the Big 5*
